## Due

  * Wednesday, May 9 by 2:00 pm to Blackboard

In this paper, you will reflect on your contributions to the class exhibit and zine, as well as on the course as a whole. How you organize your reflection is up to you, but you should discuss these 3 things:

  * The organizing logic or context behind your exhibit, and what you did to create it.
  * Your contributions to the class zine, including anything you did to make the class zine happen (anything you wrote, copied, took a picture of; any research you did; any planning or execution you did; any ideas you had; etc.); and the grade you think the class zine should receive and why.
  * An answer to this question, using specific course texts to provide evidence/context for your claims: After taking this course, how would you define the phrase “print literature after print,” and why?

## Details & Requirements

  * ~3-4 pages (double-spaced), but this is a suggestion rather than a requirement. The length requirement for this assignment is flexible. Your reflection paper should be as long as it needs to be in order for you to fully discuss the 3 things listed above.

## Grading

The reflection paper is worth 5% of your grade in this class. It will be graded on an extra credit / full credit / half credit / fail basis. For more details on this kind of grading, see the relevant section in the course syllabus.
