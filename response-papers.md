We are a small class, so your engagement with the course material is vitally important. During the first 5 weeks of the semester, you will write 3 response papers. You will write your first response paper during Week 2. Other response paper due dates are indicated on our course calendar. I will provide prompts for the response papers, and we will discuss each response paper you write when you meet with me.

Your response papers should engage with the text you are writing about in a specific, detailed way (we will talk more about what this means), but they should not be over 1-2 pages long (12 pt font, 1 inch margins).

You will write a total of 3 response papers. You should email them to me by your due date. Response papers are worth 10% of your grade in this class. They will be graded on an extra credit / full credit / half credit / fail basis. For more details on this kind of grading, see the relevant section in the course syllabus.

## Response Paper 1 prompt

Your first response paper will be a summary of the secondary source you have signed up to be responsible for during Week 2. This response paper should have the following structure:

  * Paragraph 1: Summarize – in your own words – the most important aspects of the author’s argument in this piece. Be specific rather than general, but don’t get too bogged down in small details. Be concise.
  * Paragraphs 2-3: Find two specific examples, anecdotes, and/or claims from the piece that you think best illustrate the author’s argument, and explain why they do so (1 example/anecdote/claim per paragraph).
  * &#8220;Paragraph&#8221; 4: 2 passages from the piece that you want to direct the class’s attention to (you can just quote the passages directly in list form)

Email your response paper to me by class, but you should also bring your response paper to class and be ready to discuss it in class.

## Response Paper 2 prompt

What is the significance of paper in _People of Paper_? How/why is it important? Choose 1 specific passage, moment, scene, stylistic or structural element, or pattern from the text that you think elucidates the importance of paper in this novel, and explain how it does so.

## Response Paper 3 prompt

Find something that confuses you about _House of Leaves_. I am not talking about ideas or themes or concepts in the text here; nor am I talking about the plot. I am talking about specific textual and/or aesthetic elements: find one specific word, phrase, passage, or stylistic or structural element (or a repeated pattern of these things) in the text that confounds you. BE SPECIFIC.

You should start your response paper by precisely citing the confusing thing, and then spend the rest of your paper thinking through _why_ that thing is confusing. You don’t need to come to any conclusions or discover any answers; keep an open mind.
