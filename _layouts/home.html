  <p>What happens to print literature in a digital age? A common answer to this question is that print literature is dying: today, the narrative goes, people are reading fewer books because they are spending more time engaging with digital technologies. This course responds to this line of thinking by showing how contemporary print literature continues to revitalize itself in light of digital technologies. The course focuses on the intersections between print and digital media, emphasizing works of literature that explicitly take on digital technologies and that ask us to refashion our understanding of their relationship to literature. We will read weird, strange, and unusual works of fiction and poetry by contemporary authors, and we will think about what scholars and critics are saying about these works and what they can tell us about the place of print literature in today’s digital world. The course will also include archival work in UM’s Richter Library and a final research and creative project.</p>
