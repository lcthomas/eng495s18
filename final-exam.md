## Due

  * Wednesday, May 9 by 2:00 pm

The final project in this class will be an archival project focused on the artists’ books and zine holdings in UM’s Richter Library’s special collections. We will start working on the final project halfway through the semester. It has two parts:

  1. An [individual portfolio](http://lindsaythomas.net/eng495s18/individual-portfolio/) composed of 3 different papers about your chosen artist’s book, and 1 reflection on your contributions to the class exhibit and zine.
  2. A [class exhibit](http://lindsaythomas.net/eng495s18/class-exhibit-and-zine/) about artist’s books, to be displayed in Richter Library, and featuring a collaboratively constructed zine.
