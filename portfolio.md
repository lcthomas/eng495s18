The portfolio is composed of 4 different parts. Each of these parts has its own due date, but you may also hand in revised versions of any aspect of the individual portfolio at the end of the semester for a potentially higher grade. The parts of the individual portfolio are as follows:

  1. A [rigorous physical description](http://lindsaythomas.net/eng495s18/rigorous-physical-description/) of your chosen artist’s book
  2. An [artist’s portrait](http://lindsaythomas.net/eng495s18/artists-portrait/) about the artist/author of your chosen artist’s book
  3. An [issue paper](http://lindsaythomas.net/eng495s18/issue-paper/) connecting your chosen artist’s book to an issue discussed in class
  4. A [reflection](http://lindsaythomas.net/eng495s18/artists-statement/) on your contributions to the exhibit and class zine
