## Due

  * Friday, February 23 by 10 pm to Blackboard

Choose 1 artist’s book from the Richter Library’s Artists’ Books collection. Choose wisely: you will be working with this book for the rest of the semester.

Write a 2-page description of your artist’s book. You can follow Keith Smith’s directions/methods for thinking about the book as a physical object in “The Book as Physical Object” reading if that is helpful. You should be very specific and detailed, but you should take care to _only_ _describe_ your chosen book – no interpreting allowed!

You might consider the following questions as you describe your book:

  * Is this object a book? How? What other words might you use to describe it?
  * How big or small is the book?
  * Is the book bound? If so, how? If not, how are its various component parts held together?
  * Has the artist used paper or some other material for its pages? Does it have pages? If not, what does it have?
  * What is the typography like?
  * What colors has the artist employed?
  * Does the book incorporate or include images or other visual media?
  * Is the book sculptural? If so, how?
  * Other unique features or distinguishing characteristics?

## Details & Requirements

  * 500-700 words (that’s about 2-2.5 pages double-spaced)
  * Citations and format according to some established citation style (MLA and Chicago style are generally the easiest for text. See the assignment page on our course site for links to online resources about how to format your paper using these styles).
  * Describe your chosen book, but do not interpret it. Only observe and record.
  * The title and name of the creator of your chosen artist’s book should be listed clearly at the top of your first page.

## Grading

The rigorous physical description is worth 5% of your grade in this class. It will be graded on an A-F scale. You will be graded on the specificity, rigor, and precision of your description, as well as on the overall presentation and polish of your writing. For more information on the rubric I will use to assess your graded assignments, see the relevant section in the course syllabus.
