## Due

  * Friday, April 13 by 10 pm to Blackboard

For this paper, you will choose 1 issue (or theme, idea, or concept) that has emerged from your reading and discussion in class throughout the semester (and/or from your research on the artist for your artist portrait), and write a 3-4 page paper discussing that issue in relation to your chosen artist’s book. In other words, you should make an argument about the issue’s relationship to your chosen artist’s book. How does your chosen artist’s book help us to think differently about this issue, and why is that important?

Your argument should be backed by a close reading of your artist’s book, as well as by research about your chosen issue and its intersection with our class (this research may include secondary sources from our syllabus or outside it). If it makes sense for your paper’s argument, you may choose to include an additional 1-2 artist’s books from UM’s collection in your paper (either by the same artist, or a different one). As always, choose carefully.

## Details & Requirements

  * 1000-1400 words (that’s about 3-4 pages double-spaced)
  * Citations and format according to some established citation style (<a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLA</a> and <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago</a> style are generally the easiest for text).
  * Evidence of research/incorporation of secondary sources into your argument: this will most likely mean citing the sources you used clearly and fully in footnotes or in a Works Cited page. There is no required number of sources: you should use as many sources as is necessary in order to do well on the assignment.
  * The title and name of the creator of any artists’ books discussed in the paper should be listed clearly at the top of your first page.

##  Grading

The issue paper is worth 15% of your grade in this class. It will be graded on an A-F scale. You will be graded on the complexity, originality, specificity, and overall success of your argument, on the incorporation of secondary sources into your argument, and on the overall presentation and polish of your writing. For more information on the rubric I will use to assess your graded assignments, see the relevant section in the course syllabus.
