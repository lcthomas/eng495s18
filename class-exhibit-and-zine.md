## <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exhibit</span>

Our course will culminate in the creation of artist’s book exhibits using the artists’ book collection in the UM library. For this exhibit, you will choose at least 2-3 additional artists’ books from the collection to accompany the book you have been working with all semester (please note that this is a **minimum requirement**, however; I strongly encourage you to include more items in your display). You will organize and display these books in a tabletop exhibit in special collections, using mounts the library will provide. You will also title your exhibit and write a paragraph of “label text,” explaining what your exhibit is and the works it comprises (think the text that accompanies any exhibit or artwork at a museum). During our final exam time, we will meet in special collections as a class to view each other’s exhibits, and you will give the class a 5-10-minute presentation about your exhibit.

Your exhibit should have an organizing logic or frame; in other words, you should choose works that “go together” in some way. These may be works about similar topics, works that make similar formal decisions and experiments, and/or works that ask or answer similar questions &#8212; and/or some combination of all of these. I encourage you to think about what you want your exhibit to _do_: Do you want it to make an argument about an issue? To place the artist’s book you have been working with all semester in some kind of historical or thematic context? To show some kind of historical progression? There are many possibilities.

Your 5-10-minute exhibit presentation should include the following information:

  * Your exhibit title
  * The organizing logic of your exhibit (i.e., why you chose the works that you did)
  * A brief explanation of each piece in your exhibit

## Details and Requirements

  * At least 3-4 artists’ books, including the one you have been working with all semester &#8212; you may include more, however, as your exhibit dictates
  * A complete tabletop exhibit
  * Evidence of research, including further exploration of the artist&#8217;s book collection
  * A 5-10-min presentation about your exhibit

## Grading

Your exhibit is worth 7.5% of your grade in this class (half of the total exhibit and class zine grade). It will be graded on an A-F scale. You will be graded on the overall success of your exhibit, on its organizing logic, on the evidence that you have performed research, and on the overall polish of your exhibit presentation. For more information on the rubric I will use to assess your graded assignments, see the relevant section in the course syllabus.

## <u>Class Zine</u>

As part of our exhibits, we will also be creating a collaborative class zine about artists’ books and/or the class as a whole. We will decide as a group how to organize the zine, what it will include, what it will look like, how it will be made, and how long it will be.

The zine we create will join the UM Library’s zine collection.

## Details & Requirements

In class on Wednesday, April 18, we came up with a set of requirements and expectations for evaluating the class zine. Here is what we came up with:

  * The zine should include both text and images
  * There should be some kind of discernible organizing frame, logic and/or order to the contents of the zine
  * The zine makers should take advantage of this opportunity to fully flex their creative muscles, i.e., the zine should be unique, interesting, funny, cool, etc&#8230;it should be CREATIVE
  * The zine should include at least 3 distinct types or genres of content
  * The zine makers should distribute the work of producing the zine equitably and fairly

##  Grading

The zine is worth 7.5% of your grade in this class (half of the total exhibit and class zine grade). It will be graded on an A-F scale. Barring exceptional circumstances, everyone in the class will receive the same grade for the class zine.
