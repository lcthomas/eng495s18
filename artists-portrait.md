## Due

  * Friday, March 30 by 10 pm to Blackboard

For this component of your individual portfolio, you will write a 3-page portrait of the artist who created your chosen artist’s book. This portrait should include about a paragraph of biographical information about the artist; more importantly, however, it should place your chosen artist’s book in the context of the artist’s other work. How does your chosen artist’s book relate to other work the artist has done? Is it similar to this work? A departure from this work? In what ways? Does your chosen book comment on the artist’s work in any way? How, in other words, does your chosen book fit within the trajectory of the artist’s career? Your artist’s portrait should be a narrative of the artist’s career, with your chosen book as the focal point.

Answering these questions will require you to do some research about the artist’s other work. This means you will need to read reviews of their other work, and read scholarly articles/books about their work and/or artist’s books more generally. Therefore, on **Wednesday, March 21**, we will meet in the library for a workshop on how to use the library to do research in literary studies.

## Details & Requirements

  * 800-1000 words (that’s about 3 pages double-spaced)
  * Citations and format according to some established citation style (<a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLA</a> and <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago</a> style are generally the easiest for text).
  * Evidence of research: this will most likely mean citing the sources you used clearly and fully in footnotes or in a Works Cited page. There is no required number of sources: you should use as many sources as is necessary in order to do well on the assignment.
  * The title and name of the creator of your chosen artist’s book should be listed clearly at the top of your first page.

## Grading

The artist’s portrait is worth 15% of your grade in this class. It will be graded on an A-F scale. You will be graded on the clarity and depth of your portrait, the extent of the research backing its claims, and the overall presentation and polish of your writing. For more information on the rubric I will use to assess your graded assignments, see the relevant section in the course syllabus.
